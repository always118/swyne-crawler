    <title>An Awesome new RSS Crawler Developed at IIT</title>
    <article>Today at IIT, a undergraduate computer science major participating in IPRO327 developed a web feed crawler. Ori Rawlings implemented the web feed listener to gather news articles for the teams 'Swyne' system. Swyne, being a semantically aware news search engine. After failures to implement a proper article gathering system in previous semester of the project, Rawlings stepped up to see the task accomplished. Originally planned to be first deployed on February 18th, 2009, some minor hang-ups accumulated during development pushing the inital deployment to February 23rd, 2009.</article>
